# General-Purpose Development Templates

A comprehensive collection of structured prompt templates designed to guide development teams through any type of real-world project using LLM assistance. These templates break down large development initiatives into manageable epics and user stories with clear acceptance criteria, dependencies, and success metrics.

## üìã Overview

This repository contains five comprehensive templates that cover the complete development lifecycle for any project type:

- **Project Management Template** - Complete project planning, execution, and delivery framework

## üéØ How to Use These Templates

### 1. Project Planning Phase
- Start with the **Project Management Template** for overall project planning
- Review relevant technical templates (Backend, Database, Frontend)
- Identify which epics apply to your specific project needs
- Use clarification questions to gather missing requirements
- Estimate timelines based on team size and complexity

### 2. Development Phase
- Follow epic dependencies to ensure proper development order
- Use acceptance criteria as definition of done for each story
- Regularly review and update based on changing requirements
- Track progress against success metrics
- Coordinate between different templates for full-stack projects

### 3. Customization Guidelines
