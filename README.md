# Prompt Templates for Full-Stack Development

A comprehensive collection of structured prompt templates designed to guide development teams through complex full-stack projects. These templates break down large development initiatives into manageable epics and user stories with clear acceptance criteria, dependencies, and success metrics.

## üìã Overview

This repository contains three specialized prompt templates that cover the complete development lifecycle:

- **Backend Development Template** - Comprehensive backend API and service development
- **Database Schema Design Template** - Complete database architecture and schema design
- **Frontend Development Template** - Modern frontend application development

Each template is structured as a series of epics with detailed user stories, acceptance criteria, and clarification questions to ensure thorough planning and execution.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Choose your template** based on your development focus
2. **Review the epic structure** to understand the development phases
3. **Customize the stories** to match your specific project requirements
4. **Use clarification questions** to gather missing requirements
5. **Follow the dependencies** to ensure proper development order

## üéØ How to Use These Templates

### 1. Project Planning Phase
- Review all relevant templates for your project
- Identify which epics apply to your specific needs
- Use clarification questions to gather missing requirements
- Estimate timelines based on team size and complexity

### 2. Development Phase
- Follow epic dependencies to ensure proper development order
- Use acceptance criteria as definition of done for each story
- Regularly review and update based on changing requirements
- Track progress against success metrics

### 3. Customization Guidelines
- **Technology Adaptation:** Modify stories based on your chosen tech stack
- **Scale Consideration:** Adjust complexity based on expected system scale
- **Team Expertise:** Consider team experience when estimating
- **Business Domain:** Add domain-specific epics as needed
- **Compliance Needs:** Add additional security/compliance epics if required
